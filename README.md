# Poverty-And-Equity-Analysis-Using-Tableau
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard using the World Bankâ€™s Poverty and Equity Database to explore poverty headcount ratios, regional inequalities, and GDP correlations, offering multi-level insights through advanced visualizations.

### NOTE: THE DATASET HAS MISSING DATA AND CANNOT ANSWER MOST OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW ###

Task 1:
Data Cleaning And Preprocessing:
1.Handle missing values in the Value field using Tableau's Data Interpreter or calculated fields.
2.Standardize Country_Name and Region for consistency.
3.Use filters to exclude non-country aggregates or regions if present.
4.Create calculated fields to convert poverty ratios from percent to decimal if needed and flag extreme poverty indicators (e.g., $2.15/day) separately from higher lines.

Task 2:
Poverty Headcount And Population Analysis:
1.Find the Top 10 countries with the highest poverty headcount ratio in the latest available year.
2.Average poverty headcount ratio by Region.
3.Sum population below poverty line across regions or globally.
4.Correlation analysis between GDP per capita and poverty headcount ratio.

Task 3:
Time-Series And Trend Analysis:
1.Line Chart: Poverty headcount ratio trends over time for selected countries or regions.
2.Area Chart: Total population below poverty line over time, stacked by region.
3.Heatmap: Country VS Year grid showing poverty ratio intensity.
4.Identify years or regions with the largest poverty reduction.

Task 4:
Advanced Tableau Visualizations:
1.Map: Choropleth map coloring countries by poverty headcount ratio.
2.Bubble Map: Size bubbles by population below poverty line, color by GINI Index.
3.Scatter Plot: GDP per capita VS poverty headcount ratio with region-based color coding.
4.Box Plot: Distribution of GINI Index by Region.
